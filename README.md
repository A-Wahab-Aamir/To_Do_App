<h2> This is TO Do List Application </h2>
todo list is a simple web application that allows the user to add tasks to a to-do list. It includes a form with an input field and an "Add" button, which when clicked, adds a new task to the list. Each task is represented by an li element that contains the task text and two buttons: an "Edit" button and a "Delete" button. Clicking the "Edit" button opens a prompt allowing the user to edit the task text. Clicking the "Delete" button removes the task from the list. The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be hosted on Github Pages by creating a new repository and publishing the code there.
